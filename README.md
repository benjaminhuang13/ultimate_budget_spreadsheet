# ultimate_budget_spreadsheet
I created the **Ultimate Budget Insight Dashboard** using Google Sheets. This makes it easy for anyone with almost any level of technical skills to adopt for free! 

The template can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xKW-EdDXVN5nontaMy65wKUhzzwoup9d2lv-R4R6o7s/edit#gid=1620446718). Make a copy onto your own Google Drive!

Updates will be noted in the spreadsheet's "Update" sheet. Instructions are also included on how to update your sheet. Follow the yellow highlighted comments in the spreadsheet to get started!

Reach out with any questions/concerns/feedback and happy budgeting!

## Future work
- Create savings dashboard to see how much user is currently saving and projected growth
- Create a script that helps users parse their downloaded transactions in CVS format from popular financial banks.
